			Compliance Reports are groupings of Policies. The Compliance Reports are dynamically available to the Task Scheduler when created. You are allowed to group multiple Policies into a single report, or you may choose a single report for each Policy. You should create a scheduled task to run the required reports at the required times.

			You can easily add and remove items from a report using the + and - signs between the select areas on the left and right. Removing or adding an Policy will dynamically update any scheduled report.
